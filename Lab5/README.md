Absurd victory though it is, I've created at last a repository with directories 
in the terminal on a Chromebook and pushed to Github. Seems a little silly I had
such a hang up with it, but I did.
I don't want to misrepresent this for the assignment as a ton of work totally completed,
but I am really appreciating the experience of process and repositories, etc., and I figure
it's worth including here.
Confession: the refactoring is not completed, and instead I spent what time I had focussing on 
the evaluation and write up that you asked for.
Next step for me will be to learn branching and version control.
